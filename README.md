# KNN from Scratch and Comparison with Ensemble Algorithms

This project implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm from scratch on an imbalanced employee attrition dataset.
After identifying the best number of neighbors using the accuracy score, the dataset is also evaluated using other ensemble
learning algorithms such as Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Bagging with KNN. Finally, the accuracies of all models are
compared to analyze performance differences.
